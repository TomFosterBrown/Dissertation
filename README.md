# Automated Curriculum Discovery for Emergent Reciprocity

This repository contains code used in my research for my Master's dissertation, as titled above.

The aim of the project was to find conditions under which reciprocity between two reinforcement learning agents emerges. The report can be found as a pdf file in this repository. Other files are jupyter notebooks used for testing, and a python script used with SLURM to generate results.
